## Q1: What is extreme wildfire?
Extreme wildfire events (EWEs) can be characterized by several key elements:

- **Out of Distribution Fire Characteristics**: These characteristics are specific to a particular ecosystem and represent deviations from typical fire behavior. They are predominantly driven by out of distribution fuel characteristics.
  
- **Negative Effects**:
  - **Ecological Effects**: The event results in detrimental impacts on the ecosystem.
  - **Social Effects**: The event causes significant negative impacts on human communities.

### Key Considerations
- **Control**: Is our inability to control the fire a threshold for defining an EWE? 
- **Social Impacts**: What if the fire characteristics are all within distribution, but the fire has significant social impacts?

## Obstacles to Characterizing an Event as Extreme Wildfire
1. **Data Limitations**: Lack of historical data for comparative analysis.
2. **Subjectivity**: Differences in how individuals or communities perceive and define "extreme."
3. **Ecosystem Variability**: Variations in ecosystem resilience and response to fire.
4. **Scale of Impact**: Difficulty in assessing the scale and scope of social versus ecological impacts.
5. **Disaster vs. EWE**: Understanding how EWEs differ from disasters, which may have a more defined threshold of impact or community disruption.

- **Remote Sensing Data**: Utilized for assessing vegetation and fuel loads.
- **Climate Data**: Helps in understanding fire weather conditions and trends.
- **Local Fire Records**: Historical data for assessing fire behavior and impacts.
- **Ecological Models**: Tools for predicting the potential ecological impacts of wildfires.




# Modeling Group

## Q1: What is extreme wildfire?
### Key Elements in Defining an Extreme Event
- **Statistical Thresholds**: Events categorized as extreme may be defined as occurring 2 standard deviations (2SD) outside of the statistical distribution of historical fires. 
  - **Metrics**: Consideration of which metrics to use—rate of spread, fire size, etc.
- **Data Limitations**: In models like LANDIS, capturing metrics defining extreme wildfire events (EWEs) is challenging.
  
### Obstacles to Characterizing an Event as Extreme Wildfire
- **Scaling Challenges**: 
  - How do we achieve the resolution necessary to gather the required metrics? 
  - Significant data limitations exist in modeling.
- **Temporal Element**: 
  - Some fires create intense conditions for only a short duration.
- **Definitions**: 
  - Multiple definitions could exist:
    - **Ecological**
    - **Fire Behavior**
    - **Social**
- **Landscape Scale Metrics**: Is there a landscape scale metric that might be overlooked?
- **Consequences vs. Behavior**: 
  - Not linking the consequences with fire behavior complicates the definition.
- **Data Accessibility**: 
  - After an event, quantifying what is considered extreme based on available data (e.g., spotting data).
  - Simpler statistical approaches may be more accessible.
  
### Diversity of Definitions
- Is a singular definition necessary, or can we accommodate a diversity of definitions in our review?
- **Difference from Disaster**: 
  - Extreme wildfires are not synonymous with disasters. Disasters involve broader social impacts and consequences.

## Q3: Tools/Data Sources for Monitoring Extreme Events
- **Fireline Intensity and Rate of Spread Data**: Essential for characterizing fire behavior.
- **Fire Atlas - MODIS**: Provides global data on fire boundaries.
- **Available Data**: What additional data sources can we leverage to define disasters and better understand extreme wildfire events?

## Additional Notes from Modeling Breakout Group
- **Definition**: Should be quantifiable and applicable globally without being tied to size or social dynamics. Contextualizing "extreme" based on location is critical.
- **Control Dynamics**: Resource limitations influence whether a fire is considered extreme.
- **Key Elements**: There is a struggle with the AND aspect of definitions, especially if characteristics are intertwined.
- **Generalizability of Tedim Values**: Concerns about applying these values universally.
- **Data Gaps**: There are significant gaps in available data to meet all definitional parameters.
- **Social Element Modeling**: The social component may not be easily generalizable, leading to practical challenges in defining EWEs.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Questions arise about the socio-economic data available and how to integrate social elements effectively.

## Q1: Defining Extreme Wildfire
### What is Extreme Wildfire?
- **Context Matters**: Definitions can vary based on the end user, context, and intended audience.
- **Historical Context**: Grappling with concepts like "historically unprecedented" or "outside of historical range" is essential.
- **Calibration of "Extreme"**: 
  - Is it extreme for the local unit, ecology, or management team?
  - Resources and communication networks need to be considered.

### Key Elements in Defining an Extreme Event
- **Integration of Social Elements**: 
  - Modeling should incorporate social factors to better distinguish between disasters and extreme wildfire events.
  - Consider social elements that are difficult to quantify (e.g., community values).

### Obstacles to Characterizing an Event as Extreme Wildfire
- **Definitional Trade-offs**: Boundary objects can complicate definitions—how do we reconcile different frameworks?
- **Separation of Consequences**: Understanding what modeling aims to achieve is crucial.
- **Model Limitations**: 
  - Data resolution and trustworthiness influence predictions.
  - Social vulnerability indices often fail to account for adaptive capacities.

### Disaster vs. Extreme Wildfire Event
- **Distinctions**: 
  - Extreme wildfire events should encompass broader ecological and social consequences.
  - The threshold for disaster involves societal response overload and significant negative impacts.

- **Fireline Intensity and Rate of Spread Data**: Essential for characterizing fire behavior.
- **Fire Atlas - MODIS**: Provides global data on fire boundaries and behaviors.
- **Community-Based Asset Mapping**: Important for understanding local values at risk.

## Summary of Discussion Points
- **Evaluation of "Extreme"**: Requires a reference point based on ecosystem, institutional systems, and community contexts.
- **Historical Precedence**: Events should be assessed for their novelty and distribution in historical records.
- **Consequence-Focused Definitions**: Understanding extreme wildfire events through the lens of their consequences is vital.
- **Modeling as a Social-Technical System**: Models must be contextualized and designed with audience needs in mind.

### Recommendations
- **Reverse Engineering Models**: Start with probable consequences and intended uses to design effective models.
- **Temporal Aspects**: Different decision-making processes require distinct temporal resolutions in modeling.

### Key Takeaways
- **Extreme is Contextual**: Definitions of extreme events vary significantly based on local conditions and societal impacts.
- **Distinguishing Extreme Events from Behavior**: Extreme fire behavior does not always equate to an extreme wildfire event.
- **Capacity of Control**: Understanding local histories and institutional capacities is crucial for accurate assessments.
