\#\# Daily Summaries

\#\#\# Day 1: Introduction Day  
\#\#\#\# Goals:  
\- Introduction to the workshop  
\- Introduction to extreme wildfire  
\- Identifying extreme wildfire research gaps  
\- Discussion of research gaps

\#\#\#\# Welcome to the Extreme Wildfire Workshop (Melissa Lucash)  
\- Thanks to attendees for coming to Boulder.  
\- \*\*Rationale for workshop\*\*:    
  \- Extreme events are increasing.  
  \- They exhibit exceptional fire behavior and have severe consequences.  
  \- Most current definitions focus on biophysical aspects, but we want to include other fields in defining extreme wildfire events (EWE).

\- \*\*What we want to accomplish\*\*:  
  \- \*\*2-day\*\*: Build an interdisciplinary team to synthesize our understanding of EWE, identify gaps, and create a roadmap for addressing them.  
  \- \*\*4-day\*\*: Expand the team’s work and build a Docker package for LANDIS-II to run on high-performance computers.

\- \*\*Discussion of agenda\*\*:    
  \- James talked about his background and the importance of the workshop for modeling and wildfire.  
  \- Rob introduced LANDIS and highlighted the need for social data and interdisciplinarity in fire modeling.  
  \- Branda Nowell shared her background in disaster psychology and wildfire institutional response, with examples from a Gatlinburg wildfire.

\#\#\#\# General Introductions  
\- \*\*Ali Urza\*\*: Research ecologist studying post-fire trajectories.  
\- \*\*Sean Parks\*\*: Researches fire and climate relationships in Western US forests, focusing on high-severity fire.  
\- \*\*Courtney Shultz\*\*: Focuses on policy barriers to fire and forest restoration collaboration post-fire.  
\- \*\*Cole\*\*: Researcher at CSU, collaborates with Courtney.  
\- \*\*Amanda\*\*: Works on models to inform emergency services, focusing on civilian-scale responses.  
\- \*\*Lise\*\*: Wrangles messy human observations, connects daily incident reporting to burn parameters, and studies community responses.  
\- \*\*Wesley\*\*: Master's student at UO studying vegetation changes in Alaska.  
\- \*\*Shelby Weiss\*\*: Postdoc in Illinois researching future vegetation shifts due to fire in Alaska, working at Big Rivers Research Center.  
\- \*\*Jen Faucet\*\*: Extension Forestry at NC State, working with a prescribed fire group for fuels management.  
\- \*\*Tirtha\*\*: Assistant professor at UCI studying land/atmospheric interactions, weather/fire relationships, and prescribed fire collective leader.  
\- \*\*Matt\*\*: Professor at UNM doing empirical field-based and modeling work.  
\- \*\*Zachary\*\*: Postdoc at LANL working on a wide range of modeling topics.

\#\#\#\# Introduction to Extreme Wildfire  
\- Melissa introduced the definition of EWE (Tedim et al. 2018\) and contrasted it with "megafire".    
  Discussion followed, focusing on the societal threat and perception bias of "extreme" wildfires.

\#\#\#\# Breakout Rooms: Identifying Research Gaps

\- \*\*Biophysical Field\*\*:    
  Major concepts included the exclusion of absolute thresholds from the definition and focusing on fire behaviors relative to historical regimes.  
    
\- \*\*Social Field\*\*:    
  Stuck on defining who the model is for—ground crews or ecological systems? Discussions included the nuances of community value and the complexities of disaster.

\#\#\# Day 2: Building Off Day 1  
\#\#\#\# Goals:  
\- Recap of Day 1\.  
\- Targeted group discussions addressing EWE research gaps.  
\- Synthesis of discussions.  
\- Publication planning.

\#\#\#\# Day 2 Overview  
\- \*\*Rob\*\*: We are moving toward synthesis and paper preparation.  
\- \*\*Melissa\*\*: Organized the gaps into four themes. Groups will work on each theme, list research needs, and present findings.

\#\#\#\# Group Discussions  
\- Addressed how to tackle research needs and identified missing tools and resources.  
    
\#\#\#\# Publication Plan  
\- Discussed whether to write a review or perspective piece.  
\- \*\*Possible journals\*\*:    
  \- Fire Ecology    
  \- Nature Sustainability    
  \- International Journal of Wildland Fire    
  \- Frontiers in Environmental Engineering  

\- \*\*Title suggestion\*\*: Roadmap for the Future of Extreme Fire Events (Rob).  
\- Plan to have a draft ready by February, with regular check-ins and subgroup meetings to keep momentum.
