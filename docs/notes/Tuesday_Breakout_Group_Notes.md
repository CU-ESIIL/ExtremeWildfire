## Data Limitations and Modeling Extreme Events  
### Key Points  
- **Extreme Events Are Rare**: Addressing data limitations in modeling extreme events is crucial.  
- **Model Parameterization**:   
  - There are sufficient historical events to parameterize models effectively.  
  - Modeling can generate multiple replicates for better analysis.

### Challenges with General Circulation Models (GCMs)  
- **GCM Limitations**: GCMs struggle to accurately model extremes.  
- **Resampling Observations**:   
  - Use observed data to project future scenarios (e.g., increasing frequency of drought years).  
  - Focus on enhancing downscaled wind speed and humidity data from GCMs.

### Collaboration Opportunities  
- **Engagement with Climate Modelers**: Partner with experts to improve model outputs.  
- **Addressing Uncertainty**: Resampling from reliable meteorological data can provide valuable insights.

### Prospectus Paragraph  
- **Focus on Bias Correction**: Investigate bias correction of GCM outputs at various resolutions.  
- **Utility for Decision Makers**: Assess how model corrections align with real-world experiences and what new methods are needed.  
- **Planning for Extreme Events**: Develop strategies for both common and extreme fire events, acknowledging that some scenarios may seem unrealistic but are possible.

### Research Team Composition  
- Climatologists, fire modelers, social scientists, and stakeholder engagement experts.
